### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: War time effect on inauguation Speeches
+ This project is conducted by [BOXUAN ZHAO]

+ Project summary: The United States of America has been thourgh many wars, from the bloody civil war to the intense cold war. Are these speeches similar to one another? What are the simliaries if there are any? These questions will hopefully be answered by applying text mining techniques on the speeches selected from presidents, under whom the country is at war with itself  or other countries.
