#Generally, we see that all speeches have its majority amount of sentences only have smaller than or equal to 20 words.BUt if we start to examine individual speeches, first we find out that most presidents' first and second speech(if there are any), have the similiar distribution of sentence length. Only a small amount of presdeints have their second speech significantly smaller than the first one.

#If we start to compare speeches given in tense moments and speeches given in rather peaceful or even prosper moments:

#We can see that in general, speeches give nin prosper time has a greater hortizonatal spread(namly has more sentences that are close to 20 words) than those are given during war or tense moments.

#There is no surprise that the emotion
#When examine the barplot of our selected speeches, we surprisingly see that, except the second speech given by AbrhamLincoln, during which the civil war was about to end, all the other speeches tend to have the trust emotion the most, and relative positive amotion such as joy and anticipation also came second the most. There are only three time when begative emotion such as fear came to the first and the second, and two of which came from Lincoln's two speeches, where the lst one came from FrankdRooselt's second speech. In addition, after the second speech, the postive words went back to be the top 2 emotions from Rooselevt's speech. This rather surprising pattern is interesting, as our general assumption was those speeches should not be very positive during war times.

#In addition to those, the heatmap reveals that the negative emotion sich as anger was usually related to fear and digust, where posiive emotion such as anticipitian is usually realted to joy.
